# Game-Dev-Portfolio
Hi, I have been coding since I was 11 years old in 2013. Two years later I started dabbling with game-development and have spent most of my coding time around this topic.
However, I do have experience in other software development and programming endeavours. I am a dedicated self taught and driven individual with high learning speed and capacity.
Programming languages are simply tools for executing my logic and algorithmics. I have no problem learning new ones. My core understanding of logic and computing is unaffected.
I understand object oriented principles just fine, as well as data driven design. My portfolio is constantly growing and may be outdated.
I have no problem with keeping documentation and consistent styling in check.

This repository holds much of my work from 2016 to 2023

Thank you for your time.
Please contact me for any enquiries.

Much love and warm regards,
Christiaan Visser
