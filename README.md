# Game-Dev-Portfolio
Hi, I have been coding since I was 11 years old in 2013. Two years later I started dabbling with game-development and have spent most of my coding time around this topic.
However, I do have experience in other software development and programming endeavours. I know how to use GIT and any relevant collaboration software any organisation might use.
While I have no formal training, I am a dedicated self taught and driven individual with high learning speed and capacity.
Programming languages are simply tools for executing my logic and algorithmics. I have no problem learning new ones. My core understanding of logic and computing is unaffected.
I understand object oriented principles just fine, as well as data driven design. My portfolio is constantly growing and may be outdated.
I have no problem with keeping documentation and consistent styling in check.

This repository holds much of my work from 2016 to 2023

Much love and warm regards,
